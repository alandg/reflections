How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

it highlights the changes made

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

makes it easier to see the changes to both spot issues and also to understand the progress of development and the thinking behind it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

automatic is fine for some cases e.g. writing a single document but where there are interrelated changes in code that can result in non-functional versions or that constitute specific logical changes then manual control is more appropriate.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

the point is that for code the changes across a set of files are frequently interrelated and don't make sense in isolation as opposed to say, writing a single document report that's self-contained.  git is intended for code whereas the other systems aren't.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will list the commits with comments and git diff can display the changes made between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
