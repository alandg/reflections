What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it creates the repository object and tracking files together with other required control information for git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

this is a holding area that lets us marshall a commit payload separately before actually commiting the data.  this provides a chance to review and modify this.
