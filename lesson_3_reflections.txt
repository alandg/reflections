Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

a fork is a clone of another repository with a reference to where it came from.  useful where I might want to have a traceable personal version of a project.
a clone is a complete copy of a repository that could be pushed to a separate remote with no reference.
a branch is a named set of commits within the scope of a repository either local, with remote or both.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

means you can do logs, merges and diffs offline from the last known state
